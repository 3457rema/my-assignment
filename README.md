Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, and maintaining software. It’s important because it ensures that software is reliable, efficient, and meets user needs.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1960s: The term "software engineering" was first used, emphasizing the need for better software development practices.
1980s: Structured methodologies like Waterfall were introduced to manage larger projects effectively.
2001: The Agile Manifesto was published, promoting flexibility and collaboration in software development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: Define project goals and gather requirements.
Design: Create system architecture and design specifications.
Implementation: Write the actual code.
Testing: Test the software for bugs and issues.
Deployment: Release the software to users.
Maintenance: Update and improve the software over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: A linear approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. Good for projects with clear requirements, like government projects.
Agile: A flexible approach that allows changes based on feedback. Ideal for startups developing new apps that need quick iterations.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Writes code and builds features.
Quality Assurance Engineer (QA): Tests the software to ensure it works correctly and is free of bugs.
Project Manager: Coordinates the team, manages timelines, and ensures the project meets goals.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs (Integrated Development Environments): Tools like Visual Studio that provide everything developers need to write and test code.
VCS (Version Control Systems): Tools like Git that track changes to code, allowing collaboration and easy management of different versions.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Complexity: Break tasks into smaller parts to manage complexity.
Keeping Up with Technology: Continuous learning through courses and reading.
Communication Gaps: Foster open communication within the team

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Tests individual components of the software.
Integration Testing: Tests how different components work together.
System Testing: Tests the complete system for compliance with requirements.
Acceptance Testing: Ensures the software meets user expectations before release.



Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is about creating clear prompts for AI models. It’s important because well-crafted prompts lead to better responses from AI, making interactions more effective.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about animals."
Improved Prompt: "Can you give a brief overview of mammals, reptiles, and birds, with one example of each?"
